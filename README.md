Web Security
============

There are a number of somewhat foundational documents that I think are missing
at the moment. This repo is a mechanism for me to outline the things that I
think would be useful, and, hopefully, help folks to get started actually
writing them (because I have a loooong list of unfinished projects):

* What is the same-origin policy? Why is it important? What is its impact (on
  sites, on specs, etc)?
* What threat models do we care about on the web? How can they be mitigated?
* WebAppSec explainers:
  * "What is X? Why should I care? How can I use it?"
    * CSP
    * EPR
    * SRI
    * REFERRER
  * "Why am I getting this error? How do I fix it?"
    * MIX
    * POWER
  * "How do these things fit together? What's missing?"
